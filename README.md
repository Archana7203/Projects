This project predicts the presence or absence of diabetes in individuals using different classification algorithms: naive Bayes, knn, decision tree,random forest classifier, linear SVM. The highest accuracy achieved was 96.67%. 0 indicates the absence of diabetes and 1 indicates the presence of diabetes. The user interfaces were also added using Gradio.
