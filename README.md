# 1. Hair Health Prediction

This project predicts the presence or absence of baldness in individuals using different classification algorithms: naive Bayes, knn, decision tree, random forest classifier, and SVM. Hyperparameter tuning was performed on random forest classifier to identify the best parameters. The highest accuracy achieved was 54.56%. 0 indicates the absence of baldness and 1 indicates the presence of baldness. The user interfaces were also added using Gradio.
