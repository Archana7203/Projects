I build projects related to AI/ML

#1. Hair Health Prediction
This project predicts the presence or absence of baldness in individuals while using different classification algorithms namely naive bayes, knn, decision tree, random forest classifier and svm. Hyper parameter tuning was performed on random forest classifier to identify the best parameters. The highest accuracy achieved was 54.56%. 0 indicates absence of baldness and 1 indicates presence of baldness
